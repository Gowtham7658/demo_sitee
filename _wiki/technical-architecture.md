## Overview

Technical Architecture provides comprehensive guidance on designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems for enterprise applications.

## Core Concepts

### Architecture Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture**: Build systems using independent, loosely coupled services
- **Layered Architecture**: Organize your application into distinct layers
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Design systems that react to business events
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Leverage cloud platforms for scalability and resilience

## Design Principles

1. **Scalability** - Design systems that can grow with demand
2. **Reliability** - Build systems that continue to operate under failures
3. **Maintainability** - Create code that is easy to understand and modify
4. **Security** - Implement security at every layer
5. **Performance** - Optimize for speed and efficiency

## Best Practices

- Define clear service boundaries
- Use asynchronous communication where appropriate
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Design for resilience and fault tolerance
- Monitor and observe system behavior
